###### First Application: MacroDroid

###### Link to application: ![MacroDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid)

MacroDroid is a powerful automation app that pairs intuitiveness with functionality. MacroDroid relies on “macros”. Macro describes how an input affects an output, i.e. specific triggers will cause an action to be carried out. Each macro has three primary stages: Trigger, Action and Constraints. The trigger is whatever starts a macro. For example, shaking your phone or tapping on the screen. The action is whatever task that needs to be executed. For instance, launching an app, taking a screenshot. The constraint is a set of conditions under which the macro won't trigger. 

MacroDroid takes advantage of Android's openness and versatility to allow users to automate their day to day tasks and push smartphones to do more for themselves and do more for us. MacroDroid can monitor things like the screen orientation of the smartphone, the proximity sensor, signal strengths, light levels to initiate the trigger. In my opinion with MacroDroid many routine things can become easier and can be done conveniently without any user intervention, this makes users life lot easier and will help users save both their time and energy. For example, users can set up a trigger to put the phone to silent when the user enters a specific area or the radius of the city.

###### Advantages of MacroDroid:
*	A very functional User interface. MacroDroid’s home screen is designed to make all its features easy to spot at a glance which provides a fast learning curve.
*	Beginner friendly with several pre-configured templates which allow absolute novices to automate most common tasks on the device.
*	Unlike its competitor Tasker () no root access is required and there is no steep learning curve like tasker. Users can install and  use it on the go.
*	Has a manual triggering feature which can be accessed from the notification bar, by which users can easily perform many actions on the fly.   
*	Has MacroDroid’s forums and discussions built in the app, so users can request a feature or share their macros or can ask any queries.

###### Limitations of MacroDroid:
*	Drains a lot of battery depending on the macro.
*	The advertisements can be disruptive especially when browsing the forums.


###### Improvements for MacroDroid:
*	Some of the advance options in the main menu such as Cell Towers and Geofences don’t provide any information to the users on what they do when clicked. This could be a problem for the users who are new to automation.
	




	###### First Heuristic Evaluation: Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors

	Even though the apps default interface is set up for beginners, automation of android can be intimidating and error prone at times. MacroDroid provides a forum tab on the home screen of the application to help users with help and troubleshooting. The forum tab even contains frequently asked questions for users new to the application. There is also a discussions tab for users to share their macros and answer other users queries. These features help build the community of the app and provide an incentive for the users not to abandon the application when they are facing trouble with the application.

	###### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall

	Once the user creates a macro, it is saved inside the application. The user can name their macros to their convenience, and once users create a macro, they are saved inside the macro section of the home screen. Users can just click on it and check for their saved macros. By making these options visible, the user doesn’t have to remember all macros they create overtime. The menu of the application also provides options such as system log, user log and help section. These options help users to retrieve or track their activities.

	 
	###### Second Application: Argus
	Link to application:
	 ![Argus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.versus&hl=en)

	 Argus is a health and fitness tracking application which allows users to track their daily steps and activities, set daily goals for steps, sleep time and hydration, use instant heart rate to monitor heartbeats, and create a food diary of their meals with food snapping.

	 There are many other health and fitness tracking applications in the app store which monitor user’s daily activities but what makes Argus stand out is the main user interface of the app. Argus displays user’s data which is laid out with hexagons in a honeycomb pattern. Each hexagon holds a data point of the user such as weight, steps, sleep pattern. Argus populates a section of the honeycomb with that data. For example, one honeycomb cell displays the number of steps taken by the user, while another shows total miles travelled. Once the user taps on a cell, Argus gives the user more details about the cell, such as a chart or graph of that activity. If a user taps and holds any another cell all the similar cells cobble together so that the user can easily compare the data from the previous days.

	 ###### Advantages of Argus:
	 *	The greatest attribute of the application is that its comprehensive. Users no longer must use four or five apps to keep track of sleep, diet, weight, heart rate, running.
	 *	Modern and intuitive interface. The primary motive for the users to use Argus is the way developers have chosen to display the data in a visually appealing way. The honeycomb view is eye-catching and allows users to quickly and easily view their progress in the day. 
	 *	A unique feature to track heart rate by placing the finger on the phone's camera and can also connect to other heart rate monitors via Bluetooth.
	 *	Users can integrate Argus with third-party services such as Fitness tracking devices (Fitbit) to automatically import the user data into the app. This eliminates the need for users to fill the information such as weight, height manually, thus reducing the pain point of similar applications.

	 ###### Limitations of Argus:
	 *	Requires GPS to run in the background all day long, which kills the battery.
	 *	Requires background app refresh to be enabled to track user activities which drains the battery.

	 ###### Improvements to the application:
	 *	The hexagons in the app are color-coded and might be a problem to color blinded people like myself. An option to remove the colors from the tiles can solve this problem.






	 ###### First Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design

	 Argus is attractively designed and distinctively displays data. The hexagonal tiles are minimal, and colour-coded which provides users with an easy-to-read layout and the hexagonal tiles are close to the other tiles so the user can modify or navigate without any issues. The hexagonal tiles are spaced and aligned evenly and don’t overlap with anything. The animation when clicking on the tile is simple and doesn’t distract users. The hexagonal tiles in the main layout are large and provide users all the required information they need when they open the app for the first time. The user can easily relate to the information on the tiles as they are colour-coded to match with the real world colours. For example, water tile is coloured blue. The floating action button is static on the main layout and allows users to add more information if required.

	 ###### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Error prevention

	 The application features a plus icon on the hexagonal tile to add progress to that activity. For example: if a user hits plus on the water tile the daily count will be increased to plus one glass. However, if the user clicks on that plus icon by mistake, the app increases the number by one. This error can be prevented by providing a confirmation option before user commits to the action. The user has to force touch the hexagonal tile to edit the information which is a hectic process.
